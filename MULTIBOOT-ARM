Multiboot ARM extensions v0.1
-----------------------------

This is an unofficial extension to the the Multiboot Specification version
0.6.96, available from
http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html.

It has been adapted to support booting on the ARM architecture.

Please note the changes to the following sections:

3.2 Machine state
-----------------

Replace all information with the following:

When the boot loader invokes the 32-bit operating system, the machine must have
the following state:

'R0'
    Must contain the magic value '0x2BADB002'; the presence of this value
    indicates to the operating system that it was loaded by a 
    Multiboot-compliant boot loader (e.g. as opposed to another type of boot
    loader that the operating system can also be loaded from).

'R1'
    Must contain the 32-bit physical address of the Multiboot information
    provided by the boot loader (see Boot information format).

'R2'
    Will either contain '0' or a valid 'ARM Linux Machine Type', a list of
    which are maintained at http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/machines/

'R3'
    Will either contain '0' or a valid pointer to a table of functions
    provided by the boot loader for enhanced early OS functionality
    (see 3.2.1 ARM (rpi-boot) Bootloader functions).

'SP'
    There will be a valid stack provided, however its size is not
    guaranteed.  The OS image must create its own stack as soon as
    possible.

All other registers are undefined.

In addition, the system will be running in supervisor mode with virtual
memory disabled.  Interrupts will be disabled.

The first 1 MiB of physical memory is reserved for the bootloader.  This is
not reflected in the memory map provided in the multiboot header.  Once the
OS image has finished parsing the tables provided to it by the bootloader
and is no longer using any Bootloader functions (see 3.2.1) this memory is
free for use by the OS.


3.2.1 ARM (rpi-boot) Bootloader functions
-----------------------------------------

This is a new section containing the following:

The reference implementation of the Multiboot ARM extensions (rpi-boot)
provides the OS image with functions providing functionality to
enhance early OS development, particularly concerned with debugging
output and loading files from the file system.

If R3 on boot contains a value other than '0' then it points to a table
of function pointers:

struct multiboot_arm_functions
{
    // Console output functions
    int (*printf)(const char *format, ...);
    void (*clear)();

    // File/directory read functions
    FILE *(*fopen)(const char *path, const char *mode);
    size_t (*fread)(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
    int (*fclose)(FILE *fp);
    int (*fseek)(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
    DIR *(*opendir)(const char *name);
    struct dirent *(*readdir)(DIR *dirp);
    int (*closedir)(DIR *dirp);

    // Timer functions
    int usleep(useconds_t usec);
};

with members defined as per POSIX.  In particular the clear() function clears
the screen and resets the cursor to the top left position.

Path names use the '/' character as a directory delimiter.  Files on a FAT
filesystem are referenced by their lowercase name (in particular, looking for
a file using capital letters will cause the search to fail).  Paths can be
prepended by a device name in round parentheses '()' to determine on which
device to look for a file.  e.g. to look for the file called testfile.txt
in the root directory of device 'emmc0_0' the appropriate path would be:
'(emmc0_0)/testfile.txt'.
    

3.3 Boot information format
---------------------------

Please be aware of the following when reading this section:

In the flags field, the following bits will never be set: 8, 10

The following fields have special meaning:

boot_device:
    This is a pointer to a null terminated string containing the name of the
    device from which the OS image was loaded.

drives_addr:
    This is a pointer to a list of pointers to null terminated strings
    containing all the storage device names known to the bootloader.

dives_length:
    This is the length of the above list.

vbe_control_info, vbe_mode_info, vbe_mode, vbe_interface_seg,
vbe_interface_off, vbe_interface_len:
    These are redefined to the following:
    
    Offset	Name		Function

    72		fb_addr		Physical address of the linear framebuffer
    76		fb_size		Frame buffer width << 16 | height
    80		fb_pitch	Bytes between each physical line
    84		fb_depth	Bits per pixel << 16 | pixel_order
					pixel_order:
					0:	BGR
					1:	RGB
